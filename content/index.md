# Welcome

This documentation site is generated from plain Markdown and built as a static
export. Frontmatter controls metadata such as title and description.

## Next steps

- Add Markdown files under `content/`
- Use folders with `index.md` for section landing pages
- Run `pnpm build` to export the static site
